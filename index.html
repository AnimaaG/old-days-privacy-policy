      <p><strong>Old Days</strong> is primarily an offline game. We are committed to transparency about any data that is collected or processed in connection with the app, including data collected by third-party advertising services.</p>
      <p><strong>In short:</strong> The game itself does not collect personal information for gameplay. However, the app includes a third-party advertising SDK (Start.io / StartApp) which may collect device identifiers and other technical data needed to show ads. This privacy policy explains what that means and how you can control ad-related identifiers on your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We (and third parties) collect</h2>
      <p><strong>Data collected by this app:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device or other IDs:</strong> Advertising identifier (Advertising ID / AD_ID) and other device identifiers used for advertising and ad measurement.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Who collects the data?</strong> The advertising SDK integrated into the app (Start.io / StartApp) collects and transmits the Advertising ID and related device/technical information to its servers and partner networks to serve and measure ads. The game does not itself collect or store personal user profiles for gameplay.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. How the collected data is used</h2>
      <p>The Advertising ID and related device data are used by the advertising SDK for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising and marketing:</strong> to display ads, target or personalize ads, and measure ad performance (impressions, clicks).</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud prevention and security:</strong> to reduce ad fraud and protect the ad ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Third-party advertising (Start.io / StartApp)</h2>
      <p>This app uses a third-party advertising SDK provided by Start.io (StartApp). That SDK may collect and transmit the Advertising ID and other technical/device data to Start.io and its advertising partners. Start.io controls how it uses and shares that data; please consult Start.io's privacy policy and their developer documentation for details about their data practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The app developer (Old Days) does not control or access Start.io's advertising inventory or partner decisions. If you wish to learn more about Start.io's data practices, please visit Start.io's official documentation and privacy pages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data sharing</h2>
      <p>Device identifiers and ad-related information may be shared with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start.io and its advertising partners and networks (for ad serving and measurement)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This sharing is required for ads to function and is performed by the advertising SDK, not by the game itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Security and encryption</h2>
      <p>We require that network communications use secure transport (HTTPS/TLS). The advertising SDK communicates with its servers over encrypted channels; you may review the SDK documentation for further details. However, no transmission method can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>The app itself does not retain personal data for gameplay. Third-party advertising partners (such as Start.io) may retain identifiers and related data for a period necessary to provide and measure ad services. Retention policies are determined by those third parties; please consult their documentation for details.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Your choices and opt-out</h2>
      <p>You can control ad personalization and reset or limit the Advertising ID on most devices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reset Advertising ID:</strong> On Android, go to <em>Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID</em> (or similar on your device) to reset your device Advertising ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out of ad personalization:</strong> On Android you can enable <em>Opt out of Ads Personalisation</em> (or “Ads Personalization” settings) to limit use of the Advertising ID for ad personalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit app permissions:</strong> The app requests only standard permissions needed for functionality (for example, camera if enabled). You can revoke permissions in system settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to exercise additional choices (for example, related to data handled directly by Start.io), please consult Start.io's privacy resources or contact them directly. The developer does not control third-party data retention or deletion policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>Old Days is family friendly. The game does not require account creation and the developer does not collect personal information for gameplay. However, third-party ad SDKs may collect device identifiers used to show ads. If you are a parent and wish to restrict personalized ads for a child’s device, please use the device-level ad settings described above.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Play Store (Google) Data Safety</h2>
      <p>To comply with Google Play's requirements, we disclose that the app (via a third-party advertising SDK) transmits <strong>Device or other IDs</strong> (Advertising ID) off the device and shares it with third-party advertising partners for advertising/marketing purposes. Network transmissions are encrypted in transit.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the Last updated date above. Please review this page periodically.</p>
